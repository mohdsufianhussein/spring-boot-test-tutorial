# Spring Boot Test Tutorial

This project is a central point for information on how to test with Spring Boot.
It contains some sample cases of testing Spring MVC applications (controllers, REST services).
It must be a reference to be consulted whenever we need to write Spring Boot tests and should evolve to latest Spring Boot version.
